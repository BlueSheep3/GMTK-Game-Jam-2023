# ROLES REVERSED

## theme ideas

- very vague ideas
  - reversed player <-> level / game (e.g. placing blocks in platformer)
  - reversed goal of the game (e.g. die instead of beat level)

+ platformer, control level elements / placing elements
	- player doesnt beat level (pre defined inputs)
	- make player beat level
- go in mirror world => do opposite thing / backwards
- maybe after beating level other comes that has to die

## platformer idea

- restrictions
  - area where you can place
- level elements
  - spring
  - spike
  - moving platform
  - key & door


## bugs

- weird collision slowing player down


## todo

- input display
- player robot sprite
- editable areas
- tile sprites
- music
- sfx
